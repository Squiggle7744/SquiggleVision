# About

Squigs.xyz is a full-screen squiggle discovery and viewing experience.

## Motivations

Most interfaces used to browse Chromie Squiggles, including the native [Artblocks.io](http://Artblocks.io) interface, are relatively high-friction to access and don’t always display all of the relevant information. Additionally, external sites like OpenSea/LooksRare/Archipelago/SquiggleDAO all adopt a grid-based view, despite the squiggles’ display agnostic properties. SquiggleVision provides a clean, minimalistic interface for browsing squiggles without the need for a clunky interface full of dropdowns and needless searching.

# Features

- Highly interactive
- Full Screen experience
- Random Squiggle on refresh

## Keyboard Navigation

Press `r` for random squiggle. Or use wasd/arrow keys to move between them sequentially.

# Looking Forward

Future updates will include richer data in the UI as well as provide more information on the on-chain aspects of Squiggles such as rarity, artist description, mint time, day-one-ness, etc.

## Planned Features
